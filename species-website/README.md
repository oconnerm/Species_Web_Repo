## Synopsis

Welcome to the Luminous ID Website source code. In this directory structure, you will find all the code used to deploy luminousid.org. This website and apps asociated with it was made possible by the 'Garden Club' a 2016-17 Senior Capstone team at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  

## Code Example

This is an exmaple of a firebase database call. This code exmaple was used numerous times to retrieve and send data to our firebaase database.

firebase.database().ref("speciesid/observations").once("value").then(function(snapshot) {
  snapshot.forEach(function(childSnapshot) {
    ...
  });
});
```

## Motivation

The effort to create this website and apps was made possible by the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder along with the Environmental Studies Program also at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
